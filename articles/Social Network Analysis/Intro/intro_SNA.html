                          <p>Social networks at their very fundamental level represent interconnections between various entities. While economists use social networks 
                            for understanding valuation sand ripple effects in markets, social media giants like Facebook use them to target specific audience for advertisements.
                            Developments in the field dates back to early 1900s when the concept of social networks was introduced in fields like psychiatry and psychology as 
                            sociograms <a href="#Easley2010">[1]</a>. The growth in online community has given us new opportunities of understanding societies in ways never seen before. Thus it's quite
                            natural that the field of social network analysis is getting the hype amongst computer and social scientists.  
                          </p>
                          <h4>Social Networks as Graphs</h4>
                          <hr class="d-none d-lg-block mb-0 mr-0">
                          <br>
                          <p>
                            Let us look at some of the graph-theoretic techniques applied to the global social networks and their effectiveness for understanding mass behaviors.
                            To begin with let us see how graph theory comes naturally analogous to social networks. Say we have a graph <strong> G = (V,E)</strong> then the vertices
                            in the graph are used to represent people and the edges show the relation among the subjects <a href="#Borodin2019">[2]</a>. Since graphs are used to 
                            represents the networks, it is natural to tweak the properties of graphs such as connectedness and structure to explore the social relations and information
                            propagation in the networks<a href="#Jackson2019">[3]</a>.  
                          </p>
                          <style type="text/css">
                            #mynetwork1 {
                                width: 800px;
                                height: 600px;
                            }
                          </style>
                          <div id="mynetwork1"></div>
                          <br>
                          <p>
                            The above graph of a hypothetical social network shows several properties of a social network. One of the key observation in the above graph
                            is the <strong>connected </strong> nodes (users on social media platform) versus the <strong> isolated </strong> ones. The connectedness of the graph gives rise to concept of <strong> 
                              components </strong> <a href="#Borodin2019">[2]</a> and several applications include analyzing the size and growth of these components. On a social media 
                              platform the general observation is that the users with a 
                            bigger network are less likely to leave the platform compared to the ones that are isolates. So studying the dynamics of components is important for 
                            enhancing user growth on platforms. 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            To understand how social network analysis (SNA) results in user growth let us walk through one of the studies done by Backstrom and Kleinberg <a href="#Backstrom2013">[4]</a>.
                            The study focused on predicting the romantic relations among the users. 
                            Backstrom and Kleinberg studied 1.3 million Facebook users who declared their spouse or relationship partner. Key structural features of graph edge were studied with main focus on
                           <strong>embeddedness</strong> and <strong> dispersion</strong>. <strong> Embeddedness </strong> is the number of mutual friends of two users <strong>A</strong> and <strong> B </strong>
                            such that edge <strong>(A,B)</strong> exists in the social graph. <strong> Dispersion </strong>  being the measure such that high dispersion would mean
                            that the neighbors of the users <strong>A</strong> and <strong> B </strong> are not strongly connected. If we take a look at the following graph  <a href="#Backstrom2013">[4]</a>
                             the dispersion phenomenon can easily be seen. 
                          </p>

                          <br>
                          <style type="text/css">
                            #fbnetwork {
                                width: 800px;
                                height: 600px;
                            }
                          </style>
                            <img id="fbnetwork" class="img-fluid mb-3 align-content-center mb-lg-0 border-dark rounded" src="FB_SNA.PNG" alt="">
                          <p> </p>
                          <p> 
                            Salient features to note in the above figure are the two highly dense clusters of users at top and right side versus the sparse distribution of users in rest of the graph. 
                            The experiments used the embeddedness only and achieved an accuracy of 24.7%, indicating the value of structured information in the networks. Then the authors studied dispersion 
                            and achieved an accuracy between the range 68.2% - 71.6% for various subgroups of users such as married and engaged users. Understanding of dispersion in a network can help
                            understand the consumption and production of content by a specific user by understanding different parts of their social neighborhoods. Then this understanding can lead to 
                            structuring those neighborhoods into specific structure to recommend engaging content to users <a href="#Backstrom2013">[4]</a>.

                          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                          <hr class="d-none d-lg-block mb-0 mr-0">

                          <p> Social networks are emerging at the interface of computer science and psychology. The idea of such networks is very trivial but embedding the ideas of social 
                            networks with graph theory and analytics we can analyze understand society from a completely different frame. The example of dispersion showed that the internal 
                            structure of graphs can tap into latent patterns which might not be obvious to humans. Social networks can be applied to understand mass behavior of voters to improve
                            operations efficiency at large organizations. This article is meant to be a starting point for readers and aims to intrigue your curiosity towards more creative applications
                            of social network analysis.
